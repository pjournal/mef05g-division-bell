&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can take a look at the Shiny App created by using Izmir's Fish Market data by clicking ***[here](https://divisionbell.shinyapps.io/fishprice/)***. The source data is a CSV file which is obtained from Izmir Metropolitan Municipality's **[Open Data website.](https://acikveri.bizizmir.com/en/dataset/balik-hal-fiyatlari/resource/022e9a4d-b184-495f-8dc2-734fb07e350c=)**

## Group Project

This project explains some insights about **Natural Gas Market in Turkey** and all the processes that were completed in order to obtain the results.

* Our main goal is to express current values and changes in both datasets which include Gas Reference Prices and Total Trade Volumes for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.
* We visualized values of Gas Reference Price and Total Trade Volume of years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 as well as their average and change depending on different time periods.
* We also analyzed some critical points that carry anomalies such as daily and monthly maximums and minimums.

The source data is 2 CSV files which are obtained from EPIAS' **[transparency platform website.](https://seffaflik.epias.com.tr/transparency/)**

### 1-) Preprocessing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see the first part of our group project by clicking ***[here](https://pjournal.github.io/mef05g-division-bell/pre_processed.nb.html)***. As a result of our preprocessing, we have obtained the ***[.rds file](https://pjournal.github.io/mef05g-division-bell/natural_gas_data.rds)*** which will be used further on.

### 2-) Exploratory Data Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second part of our group project, we have created an EDA report. You can see the HTML page of the report by clicking ***[here](https://pjournal.github.io/mef05g-division-bell/eda.nb.html)***.
